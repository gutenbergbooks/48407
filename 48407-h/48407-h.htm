<p>Sunset, the Magazine that Pictures the West
and stimulates interest in all things beyond
the Rockies, here points the way of tourist
travelers to a most attractive and instructive
feature in Far Western sight-seeing&mdash;the Wondrous
Rail Highway Along the Pacific, joining California
and Oregon, skirting spectacular Shasta, and over the
sightly Siskiyous to the fast-flowing Columbia, through
thousands of acres of roses and sweet peas, oranges
and walnuts, wheat and hops, apples and apricots,
with new things to see at every turn, and every
comfort all the way. And don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;ll
find a continuation of this story, and will find other
stories and pictures that will prove as interesting,

<p>A thousand wonders? The man who gave that as a result of his count
evidently dodged his task. If he&rsquo;d counted all the things that set one
wondering&mdash;things God-made and hand-made, things of sky and sea, of ca&ntilde;on
and mountain, and field and forest&mdash;along this thirteen hundred miles of
highway he would never have stopped at a mere thousand. Ten thousand
would have been something like it,
but modesty is a decent and not over-worked virtue, and ought to be
cheered wherever seen. Let it go at a thousand
and see if the glory of these wonders may be
impressed upon you. The climate is first, of course.
You cannot overlook the novel joy of a region where
on New Year&rsquo;s day, they battle with roses
instead of snowballs. In the country around Los Angeles they do
that sort of thing as a fixed festival, but the same floral ammunition,
and the blue sky and soft air are the winter characteristics of a hundred
other places along this road that joins Los Angeles to Portland,
passing through San Francisco&mdash;this Coast Line and Shasta Route.</p>

<p>Away down in the southwest corner of this great nation of
ours, behind mountain barriers, is the sun-kissed region that draws each
year to it an army of tourists and seekers for that priceless joy that&rsquo;s
valued most when it&rsquo;s lost health. It&rsquo;s the great Land of Out-of-Doors
here, with sunny skies and a climate that invigorates all the year around,
all the way across the mesas and tablelands of the Painted desert region,
across New Mexico and Arizona, across sandy wastes and cactus-spread
plains into the Californian oasis country, where water and wisdom have
helped make a paradise for all who believe that Nature is
the best of doctors. It&rsquo;s a sunshine orgy all the
way. And Los Angeles, with its palms and
olives, its crumbling adobes, side by side
with thirteen-story fire-proof steel business
blocks, electric railway cars
whizzing everywhere&mdash;what a marvel of the Past, jostled by
Progress! Here are hotels of all sorts and sizes, and homes that are
marvels of luxury and elegance. Here you can study climatology
and sociology, with variations; can view the simple life through the
eyes of the man whose only home is a covered wagon; or, you can
get a permit to enter the iron gateway of the park of some retired
millionaire. Los Angeles, however, with all its charms, is only one small
corner of Out-of-Door Land. The holy fathers of Mexico and old Spain
found that out over a hundred years ago, when they started from
Loreto, in Paja California, to make their mission pilgrimage up the
Alta California coast. From San Diego and Los Angeles they headed
northerly, establishing their mission stations a day&rsquo;s journey apart. In sheltered
valleys, on slopes that look far to seaward, by never-failing water
courses, they planted the cross and marked out the boundaries of their
holdings. No wide roadways could
be thought of, but connecting
these stations there soon was
marked a broad trail&mdash;<i>El Camino
Real</i>&mdash;the Highway of the King.
Perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;this name
was given to do double honor&mdash;to
the King of Kings, whose cross
the padres bore, and to that
monarch of Castile, whose bidding
they were doing in aiding to
carry his dominion into the newer
world. Up the coast this old-time
highway ran and to-day the steel highway
of The Road of a Thousand Wonders
follows it closely at many points, joining the
missions of Los Angeles, San Gabriel, San Fernando, San Buenaventura,
Santa Barbara, La Purisima, Santa Ynez, San Luis Obispo, San Miguel,
San Antonio, Soledad, Carmel, San Juan, Santa Cruz, and others, just as
musically named. The railway touches or runs close to all of these. At
all these spots these wise men of the long ago found attractive sites, all
under health-giving sun, and bathed by pure air, with a benign climate
the year around. At Sonoma, a little north of San Francisco, the King&rsquo;s
Highway ended, but adventurous spirits pushed on northerly, up
the headwaters of the Sacramento, and over the mountains into
the Oregon wilderness, meeting before then trails of trappers
and <i>couriers du bois</i> of the old Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. And, over this
trail of the trappers, runs the steel highway of to-day, bearing the traveler in
comfort amid historic scenes. All of which&mdash;that well-worn Highway of
the King, the missions, the trail of the trappers&mdash;sounds like romance with
a liberal blend of realism. These twain are characteristic of all the big
West&mdash;webs of romance and realism, lines of sentiment and science crossing
and recrossing. It&rsquo;s a garden land for poet or novelist.</p>

</div>
<p>Thus Joaquin Miller, poet and philosopher of California, sings:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Behold this sea, that sapphire sky!</p>
<p class="t0">Where nature does so much for man,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall man not set his standard high?</p>
</div>
<p>And plots for novels like Helen Hunt Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ramona,&rdquo; are lived not
at all infrequently. The old Del Valle ranch&mdash;Camulos&mdash;where the author
of &ldquo;Ramona&rdquo; stayed for
a while&mdash;is yearly becoming a more popular pilgrimage. It&rsquo;s
a quaint, low-porched, thick-walled adobe ranch-house, close by the
train&mdash;a type in its way of the California life that is past.</p>

</div>
<p>Some years ago the books of Charles Nordhoff, correspondent
and journalistic freelance, were widely read, largely because
he had the gift of seeing and of making others see through his words
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
with his eyes. His letters to eastern publications
were filled with his vivid pictures
of this southland country. In the snug
Ojai valley, close by the Coast Line, where
now a town bears his name, he came and
made his home for many years. Here,
beautifully framed by rugged mountains, is
one of Nature&rsquo;s sanitariums where crowds of
health seekers come annually to enjoy the
dry air, cooled to reasonable comfort by the
nearness to the sea. Not far away, traveling
by the direct Coast Line from Los
Angeles, is Oxnard, site of a beet-sugar factory
that sweetly influences the freight shipments
with its large annual output of the finest sugar. Something like
23,000 tons or 46,000,000 pounds of sugar are turned out here annually.
In the regular season over 2,000 tons of beets are handled daily.</p>

</div>
<p>Walnuts, olives, oranges, beet-sugar and beans are the notable features of orchard
and field in the region about San Buenaventura. The old mission, in excellent
preservation, established in 1782, is still used as the parish church for that region.
All the way from here to Santa Barbara and beyond, the traveler is
continuously under the spell of the sea, for the track skirts the coast
upon the bluff high above the booming surf, by ever-changing pictures of
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
clouds and sea and sky, with an occasional steamer or sailing craft
to give them life. Along here is Carpinteria, an old Spanish settlement,
which possesses among its features of interest, an ancient trellised
grape vine, nearly three feet in diameter at its base. At Summerland
there is a veritable forest of oil derricks stretching along the
beach, many of them in the surf and even at sea far beyond the low tide mark.</p>

the sea, as its name suggests. It is a colony of summer and winter
homes, with climbing roses, and palms and tropical foliage waving
in the gardens all about. Miramar is a suburb of Santa Barbara, as is
Montecito, another charming foothill site for country homes.</p>

<p>And then Santa Barbara, peerless among all-the-year-round resorts. It
is backed by mountains that rise high above the city and shelter it from
every wind, facing a channel and bay of remarkable beauty and calmness,
with a temperature of wonderful equability, with groves of oranges and
olives and lemons, with the tropic foliage of date-palms and bananas, magnolia,
oleander and other graceful trees and shrubs, with unrivaled gardens
of perpetual bloom and fragrance: easy of access, unexcelled for its schools
and libraries, with social advantages among people of culture and cheerful
living. The place has ever been a favorite winter resort for health tourists,
and in summer Californians have long frequented this beautiful coast city,
with its remarkable stretch of bathing beach and its charming walks and
mountain drives, its opportunities for athletics and all out-of-door sports.</p>

</div>
<p>The hotels are first-class in their equipment, the
principal ones being the Arlington and the Potter.
The new railway station of the Southern Pacific
has been built close by the Potter, and the city
grows close about it. The hotel grounds are elaborately
laid out, running down to the long boulevard that fringes
the stretch of perfect ocean beach. Close by is a well-equipped bath-house,
with the ocean itself as an annex for more ambitious swimmers.
The population of Santa Barbara and suburbs is made up very largely of
people world and climate-weary, driven by stress of storm or cold from
more rigorous climes. Here, upon these foothills, surrounded by Nature&rsquo;s
lavish bounty, they have built their homes, prepared to face their
future in climatic comfort. The city&rsquo;s chief attraction is Mission Santa
Barbara. The church is of dressed stone and adobe, with massive walls
heavily buttressed. The towers yet shelter the chime of bells, and the
famous garden with its fountain, so often pictured, still fills the air
with fragrance. Buildings have been carefully preserved, and form
to-day the most interesting and imposing of all the California missions.
The average annual winter temperature here is fifty-four degrees; the
summer, sixty-five. Seldom does the temperature rise above eighty
degrees or go below forty, but there&rsquo;s a tonic of new life in the air,
even though it has no month so cold as April at Atlantic City, nor any
month so warm as New York&rsquo;s June. Here Stewart Edward White,
the man who wrote &ldquo;The Mountains,&rdquo; that stirring epic of Out-of-Doors,
has his year-around home. To seaward from Santa Barbara can be seen
the Channel islands, wondrous isles for fishermen and tourists. The
marvelous caves running in from the sea, the seal, the
Indian relics, the plants and trees, are all of strange interest.
The run up the coast from Santa Barbara to Surf, and nearly all the way
to San Luis Obispo, is, to him who loves the sea, a never-ending source of delight.</p>

<p>At Elwood, one passes the pioneer olive farm of Mr. Ellwood Cooper,
who came here from Boston over a quarter century ago, when olive oil, oil pickles and
kindred industries were almost unknown in this country as commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>All this region, the rolling hills to the east and the high plateau that
runs far out on the Point Concepcion peninsula, once formed the domain of the
native Californians, many of them grandees of old Spain. Like lords of the Middle
Ages these land-holders held large possessions under grant from the king,
ranging their stock over vast ranches of from fifty thousand to one hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
thousand acres. Of such was El Cojo rancho
around Point Concepcion; the Santa Margarita,
El Sur, Piedra Blanca, and a hundred
others. These ranches are being cut up very
rapidly to satisfy the demands of increasing
population and of appreciative home-seekers.
To these old families California
to-day is indebted for many musical names&mdash;Arguello,
Castro, Estudillo, Pacheco, Vallejo,
Peralta, Alvarado, and many others are here,
the lingering of early-day nomenclature amid
the present made-over maps.</p>

<p>Beyond Point Concepcion, to the east are two
of California&rsquo;s most fertile valleys, the Lompoc
and the Santa Ynez, fruitful, progressive,
ideal locations for the farmer and fruit-raiser.
Here, too, are located, two of the most
interesting of California&rsquo;s missions, La Purisima Concepcion and Santa
Ynez. La Purisima mission is reached from Lompoc by way of Surf, and
Santa Ynez from Los Olivos, by way of San Luis Obispo, or from
Gaviota, by a picturesque highway, leading over the mountains, through the Gaviota
pass, and close by the wildly beautiful ca&ntilde;on and falls of Najoqui.</p>

<p>Down San Buenaventura way the traveler has seen beans in thousand-acre tracts, beans
by the million, shipped in sacks to help out the world&rsquo;s food supply. Along
here, at Occano and Arroyo Grande, enterprising seedsmen are growing
peas, peas by the million, but they are sweet peas, whose value is in
the blossom and not in the pod. It is a sight worth crossing many
continents to look upon&mdash;a sweet-pea farm in full bloom. A resort near
Oceano is El Pizmo beach, over twenty miles long and several hundred
yards wide&mdash;as pretty a piece of sand stretch as uncle Neptune ever bade
his ocean minions to build. The pounding waves of countless centuries
have here rolled the white sand upon a firm, gentle slope forming a bathing
beach large enough to wash half the world upon, while forming an automobile
speedway that can hardly be surpassed and that is largely patronized.
And a good part of the world is learning about El Pizmo, surely and
enthusiastically. An elaborate resort hotel has been built here; attractive
cottages have gone up on the sand dunes here about, and a tent city has
been built. Near here, too, is La Grande beach, a wonderful sight to see.</p>

<p>From far away the traveler approaching San Luis Obispo&mdash;the city
whose mission was named by the Franciscans to honor the memory of their beloved
bishop of Tolosa&mdash;sees a series of mountains that make him wonder if
he is in the land of
the Ptolemys. There are few more interesting or stranger formations
than these pyramids that form the setting of San Luis Obispo; one that
is peculiarly cleft, suggests a bishop&rsquo;s miter, and this quaint freak of nature
is said to have inspired the Padre Lasuen to give the city its name.
The well laid out city is finely built, with many shade trees,
well made roads, excellent water system, electric light
and gas. In location it resembles Los Angeles, though it is
nearer the ocean. The summer temperature has a maximum
of ninety-four degrees; the winter minimum is thirty-two
degrees. Lemon and orange trees thrive and roses bloom the year around. The many
drives include a twelve-mile ride to El Pizmo, already described,
a seven-mile trip to the famous San Luis Hot Springs with its sulphur plunge and
baths located amid a beautiful sycamore grove, a nine-mile journey to Avila beach, near
Port Harford, a fourteen-mile excursion to the famous Morro, with its singular rock towering
above the ocean, and a seven-mile ride up Reservoir Ca&ntilde;on. In the heart of the
town is the old mission, founded in 1772.</p>

<p>From San Luis Obispo northerly, the railway climbs
the Santa Lucia mountains, spurs of the Coast Range, noted for
the beauty of their ca&ntilde;ons, their oak-clad hillsides, their trout
streams, their wild flowers in springtime, with marvelous bits of highland
scenery at every curve of the road. The train comes close to playing
crack-the-whip at several points over the Santa Lucia grade, and one may see at frequent
intervals, far below, the track which the train has just
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
covered. Down the upper or northern slope of the Santa Lucias the
train enters the Salinas valley, producer of wheat, of fruit, of stock&mdash;one
of the oldest settled and best known of the paradise valleys of the state.
It is narrow here at this upper end, with heavily wooded slopes and
hundreds of streams that come tumbling down to the Salinas river which
flows in a northerly direction to the beautiful bay of Monterey.</p>

<p>At Atascadero one may see the maneuvering
ground of a recent encampment of national guard and regular army soldiers.
If men who go to war could have their choice of an ideal camping and fighting
country they would surely select a spot like this, with plenty of
shade, plenty of water, rolling hills for defense, and ambuscades of
chaparral and manzanita on the hillsides for shelter. This site is one
of several recommended for one of five permanent army camps, where
volunteers and regulars may be drilled side by side. Another is
the great Nacimiento ranch that lies beyond the Mission San Miguel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Beyond this point the valley broadens and the road enters the hot
spring region, in the center of which is El Paso de Robles, the &ldquo;pass of the
oaks.&rdquo; Here at Paso Robles and at Santa Ysabel, close at hand, are mineral
springs of all sorts and temperature, clay-mud, sand, iron, sulphur,
soda, lithia; all within a small area as if marshaled for the healing of the
nations. The elevation is 720 feet above sea level, about that of Carlsbad,
Baden-Baden, or Kissingen. A flowing well furnishes 2,000,000 gallons
daily of hot sulphur water, excellent for both internal and external uses.
The hot lithia spring is 124 degrees; the great sulphur spring 107 degrees.
The sanitary value of these wonderful founts of healing was recognized
long ago, and every season seekers for health come to be cured,
as the sufferers of France make pilgrimage to Lourdes; the dry air, the
sunshine, the healing waters from Nature&rsquo;s laboratory soon make the
patient feel as good as new.</p>

that expresses the last word, architecturally and scientifically, in the line
of a bath house. It is completely fitted for the use of all modern water cures.
It cost over $100,000. Into it has gone the thought and suggestion of the
best authorities in hydrotherapy. The baths are fitted with a splendor
that suggests the bathing luxuries of ancient Rome&mdash;pure white marble
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
from Carrara, glazed white tiles, &ldquo;novus&rdquo; glass for the mud baths, porcelain

by a competent physician, expert in the methods of securing the most
effective results from water treatment. The latest apparatus has been
secured, and nothing in the scientific application of water, hot-air, hot-mud,
vapor, or electricity, is wanting. Paso Robles is the center for
many interesting drives, and time runs rapidly driving, riding or automobiling
about the hills, to the seacoast, or to Mission San Miguel.
Any of these drives among the hills, under the oaks out in the sunshine,
will produce results that any doctor would be proud to send a bill for.</p>

<p>Beyond San Miguel and its mission, quaint and interesting, is Bradley,
where there are large coal deposits, and oil experts look wise when they
rove in this region. Westward from San Lucas and King City is the Jolon
valley and the San Antonio country, in the heart of which is the Mission
San Antonio de Padua, established 1771, one of the most ambitious in
architecture of these citadels of faith. It has crumbled sadly from lack
of care, but the restoring hands of the Landmarks Club are planning to

<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
springs are close by; the Paraiso, reached by stage
from Soledad, near where is Mission de Maria Santisima
de la Soledad, established 1791. Two hours&rsquo;
drive away is one of the wonders of the trip, Vancouver&rsquo;s
Pinnacles, now a government forest reserve.
Here are vast piles of rock, that form an interesting study to the geologist
and naturalist. Vancouver, exploring this region long ago, is credited with
the discovery of this strange grove of granite and basalt monuments.
Going on, the Spreckels beet-sugar refinery, the largest in the world, is
seen to the west, just south of Salinas. Every season more than
200,000 tons of beets go into the capacious mouths of this modern
monster that works a chemical miracle&mdash;turning raw root product into
finest sugar. The output last season (1906) was close to 30,000 tons
of sugar. The factory&rsquo;s daily capacity is 3,000 tons of beets. Over
20,000 acres are planted to sugar beets, annually.</p>

<p>Salinas is the county seat of Monterey county and a big shipping point,
sending vegetable products of the valley away to the markets of the
world. Along here the road trends oceanward once more, the pure ozone
of the Pacific, fresh blown by the never failing trade winds across thousands
of miles of sparkling foam, tempers the warmth of the summer
day with tonic effect and the air once again has the tang of the salt sea.
Castroville is not far from it, and Hotel Del Monte&rsquo;s park-like grounds
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
skirt the ocean&rsquo;s shore for miles. Close by is old Monterey, where
Commodore Sloat first raised the stars and stripes in California;
where the constitution of the state was formulated; where to-day
are some of the best preserved of the tile-roofed adobe buildings
of early California. The entire Monterey peninsula, with its Pacific

among them being the eighteen-hole golf course, laid out on the oak-shaded

temperature is never too high, cool breezes from the sea are always
present, and disagreeable weather never interferes with a game. The
links, only a short distance from the hotel, are the finest on the coast,
if not in the country. The greens are kept in the best possible condition;
water being piped to all of
them and men constantly employed in cutting and rolling. All the fashionable
tennis, polo and automobile clubs make Del Monte their headquarters.
The race track is for gentlemen&rsquo;s races, and famous events occur
at intervals, summer and winter. Health and comfort, but always health, were
the first thoughts of the designer of Del Monte. The advantages in and about Del
Monte and Monterey are to be noted&mdash;the favorable and uniform conditions
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
of the weather, constant ozone,
tonic and balsamic odors from the pine forests; excellent and unusual drainage;
pure water brought in pipes from the upper Carmel river; all forming a combination
not found elsewhere. The result is best shown by medical reports from
the Fifteenth Infantry, lately stationed at the Presidio. In the three
years&rsquo; time, among over two thousand people, only one death occurred
from natural causes, and that resulting from dissipation. The winter
race track at Del Monte is a mile course, and admirably suited for the
accommodation of the strings of eastern horsemen. In season, salmon
fishing on Monterey bay forms an exciting and popular diversion.</p>

<p>All this by-the-sea region, including the coast northerly to San

<p>Santa Cruz, &ldquo;city of the holy cross,&rdquo; is the Newport or Atlantic City of
the state, with its long stretches of beach, its seaside hotels all the way
from Capitola and beyond, and its attractive homes on the hillsides
that look out over the ocean blue. Here, too, is a tent city, a new
pavilion, casino and bathhouse, recently constructed at an expenditure
of somewhere near a quarter million dollars. Crowds gather here every
summer and the place is fast winning recognition as a winter resort;
a modern city for health and recreation in season. Fishing sportsmen
make their headquarters here, too, salmon fishing being one of the sports
that attracts them here especially; the salmon being a fighting foe that
makes the sport fully as attractive as tuna or tarpon in other better-known
fishing grounds. Capitola, Santa Maria del Mar, Seabright, the
Twin Lakes park, and other points close at hand, connected by electric
railway, are all attractive spots where the idler may spend weeks of enjoyment.
From Santa Cruz, northerly, the road runs through the Santa
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Cruz mountains, a region of country homes and farms, famed for their
table grapes, for their prunes and apricots and apples. The big redwood
trees (sequoia sempervirens) of these mountains invariably attract
the stranger. One can see many of these close by the train, but if the
traveler has the time, the trip to Big Basin Park, a preserve set apart
by the state, will show a forest display never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Keeping to the main road, northerly,
from Monterey the traveler
soon enters the great Santa Clara
valley, passing not far from the
well preserved Mission San Juan
Bautista, established 1797.
Through the valley, fertile and
fruitful, parks of live oak and the
seed farms&mdash;thousands of acres of
sweet peas, of marketable bulbs,
vegetable and floral&mdash;form the
noticeable features. And these
live oaks of California are marvelous.
They are ever green like
those of Palestine. Here are oaks
that may have served as roofs to Indian council halls, with closely-lapping
leaves that shed the rain and hide the sun, with branches that spread so
wide and bow so low that they seem like great sheltering arms that both
caress and protect. And then come the prune orchards, for this is the
great prune producing valley of California. In Santa Clara county alone
are planted more than five million prune trees. In the center of this
orchard valley is San Jose, one of the oldest and most attractive cities of
California. Here are excellent tourist resorts, the Hotel Vendome and
the St. James, and up the mountains to the east one may see the white
dome that shelters the great Lick telescope
on Mount Hamilton. San Jose is a wide-awake
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
city, with smoothly paved streets, attractive parks, excellent schools
and all advantages of a cultured up-to-date community, including
electric railroads and libraries.</p>
<p>From San Jose the road continues through the Santa Clara
valley, up the San Mateo and San Francisco peninsula, one of the most attractive
sections of California. Here are more suburban residences, some with vineyards and
orchards, all with superbly kept lawns. Palo Alto is the site of the Stanford University,
a marvel among the colleges by reason of its rapid development, its wonderful
endowment, aggregating $30,000,000, and its superb equipment of buildings and
men. Burlingame, San Mateo and Redwood, fill for San Francisco much the
place that Lenox or Brookline do for Boston with people of wealth and culture.</p>

<p>In San Francisco&mdash;righting
itself rapidly since the great disaster of April 18-20, 1906&mdash;one
may readily pass two weeks or more in diversified pleasure,
entertainment and instruction. Here is a city of 500,000, eighth
among the cities of
the United States at the last census and in line for sixth place. Everywhere the demands
of trade and of modern civilization are crowding the city. In its harbor the ships of
war of all the nations of the world could float, with room and to spare. The climate
welcomes the health-seeker and the man who would live out of doors all the year.
The fast-growing city, with buildings going up everywhere to replace those lost in
the big fire, is the heart of the state. Real estate sales and clearing-house
figures, assessor&rsquo;s valuations, all show
the city&rsquo;s present progress. Still
westward across the Pacific to the
Philippines, to Japan, to the Orient;
southerly to Hawaii, to Tahiti, New
Zealand, Australia; northerly to
British Columbia, the Alaskan archipelago,
Cape Nome, and the gold
region of the Klondike, the advancing
commercial movement tends. In
the nine months following the disaster,
to February 1907, building
permits aggregated $40,128,753, while
bank clearings have gained steadily,
amounting for example to $204,512,323
for January, 1907, compared
to $185,519,862 for January, 1906.
Here most decidedly is a city of
destiny. Here is the soft air and
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
blue sky of Italy, the views of Naples, the hills of Rome, the winter
climate of the Riviera, and people who, in the face of severest stress
have shown themselves possessed of the combined attributes of New
England energy and Oriental luxury.</p>

<p>For all of California&rsquo;s
richness, San Francisco is
the centering point. It is
upon the west shore of San
Francisco bay, a land-locked
harbor that has been both the
pride and marvel of navigators
ever since Lieutenant Juan De
Ayala, in August, 1775, sailed in
to the harbor through the Golden
Gate and told the world of its
wonders. The coming of the
padres and the founding of the
Mission was the virtual founding
of the city, for about the Mission
soon grew the small settlement
of Yerba Buena. Then on January
19, 1848, came the discovery
of gold. Within two
years over 100,000 adventurous
men came, and many remained
to help upbuild San Francisco
and California. Across the bay
on the eastern shore is Oakland,
third city on the coast, with its
175,000 people. It is a city of slopes covered with
charming homes, spreading northward to the city of
Berkeley, seat of the great University of California and
noteworthy for its loveliness. Southward and adjoining is
Alameda. These sister cities perhaps unexcelled in the world as a residence
section, are now assuming great business importance also. San Francisco&rsquo;s
commerce increases steadily. In the great fire of April, all the water
front with the wharves and steamer docks, was untouched. The harbor
of San Francisco is a wonder among harbors, the bay and its connections
extending north and south for about forty miles, affording anchorage for
the merchant fleets of the world. It is entered through the Golden Gate,
a passage five miles long, and one mile in width at its narrowest portion.
These straits within recent years, 1890 to 1904, have been fortified with
the most approved ordnance, and the fortifications are recognized by military
experts as among
the best defenses of any city of the nation. Within the bay, several islands are controlled
by the government and fortified, while at the Government Navy Yard, and
at Mare Island, north of the city, and at the Union Iron Works, on the peninsula, are
docks capable of receiving modern warships. Here at the Union Iron Works
have been built some of the crack ships of the navy, including the cruisers
Charleston, San Francisco, Olympia, the battleships Oregon, Ohio, South
Dakota, Wisconsin, and a number of smaller craft.</p>

<p>As Vesuvius is to Naples, so is Tamalpais to San Francisco, though the
menace is missing, the crater no longer shows the signal cloud of sullen fires.
Its extinct volcanic summit rears itself 2,590 feet above sea level, as one
looks across the bay from the city. Up its slopes runs a railway that is a
marvel of engineering construction. It&rsquo;s quite the popular thing to hie away
to the eyrie tavern on the crest of this mountain, there to be alone with
the sea and sky and one&rsquo;s thoughts. Gertrude Atherton&rsquo;s latest novel was
written amid these surroundings. Around the base of this mountain are
sheltered slopes on which are the homes of San Francisco
residents; across the bay, by Oakland, Berkeley and Alameda, the home district runs.</p>

<p>Heading northerly, crossing San Francisco bay, the road skirts the eastern shore
passing Selby&rsquo;s where gold quartz is transformed into bullion; the Mare Island
Navy Yard, the naval center of the coast; by big grain-shipping warehouses and
across Carquinez straits. The train at this point goes upon a monster ferry that
carries it over the swift inflow of the Sacramento river. Here at Benicia is the government
arsenal, then comes the duck country&mdash;the famous Suisun marshes.
Across the straits from Benicia shows the summit of Mount Diablo, 3,849 feet,
meridian base for this region. Near by, are the fruitful San Ramon and
Alhambra valleys. Close by is Byron Hot Springs, a famed resort for
invalids. Along the shore of the Sacramento river is Stockton, famed for
its manufactures, also the towns of Vacaville, Woodland and Winters, all
of them thrifty and rapidly growing centers of California&rsquo;s fruit industry.</p>

history. It was to this point that John Marshall brought in January,
1848, the news, so soon to travel far and wide, of the discovery of gold
in the millrace at Coloma. The fort is now a museum maintained by the orders
of the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West. Here are stored
reminiscences of the past; among them an old stage coach, riddled with bullets&mdash;placed
there by ambitious highwaymen, and a prairie schooner with its
old equipment reminds one of early overland history.</p>

<p>Sacramento is a modern city with many miles of electric railway and paved
streets running out to suburban orange and olive groves in the attractive
suburbs, and past the
capitol building and surrounding park. In the Crocker art gallery, established
more than thirty years ago by Judge E. B. Crocker and Mrs. Crocker
is a notable collection of paintings well worth the time of inspection
by the art connoisseur. In this gallery of seven hundred
paintings, chiefly by foreign artists, are to
be found some of the canvases of Van
Dyck, Murillo, Guido Reni, Salvator Rosa,
Correggio, Tintorretto, Leonardo da Vinci,
Luini, Sir Peter Lely and others,
and some fine examples from
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Piloty, Kaulbach, Thomas Hill and other modern masters. In addition,
are many folios of inestimable value, containing original drawings from
old and modern masters which were secured from the studios and collectors
in Europe during the Franco-Prussian war. There is also exhibited in the
building a large and valuable collection of minerals, in cabinets, the property
of the state of California. The gallery is open every day.</p>

<p>From Sacramento there are numerous side-trips up into the gold mine
region of California, to Grass Valley, Oroville, Placerville&mdash;regions that are
known largely through the fascinating writings of Bret Harte.
Around Oroville and along the Feather river may be seen that
marvel of gold mining, the electric dredger. These monster
burrowers are here eating their way steadily into the gold-bearing
soil. In many places this work is going on industriously
in the center of profitable bearing orchards, but the gold from
within is found by this process to yield to greater profit than
the golden fruit produced by trees on the surface. And then
from Sacramento the great valley broadens out. To the north
is the vast orchard region of Sutter county, and the great
granaries of Colusa, Glenn and Tehama counties; south of the
city, and close by, is the slough country, where in the fertile, fruitful
ground&mdash;fertile as the valley of the Nile or the rich dike-inclosed
country of Holland&mdash;are vast stretches given up to vegetable growing,
especially of asparagus, celery and potatoes. This valley of the Sacramento is an
empire with many principalities. Such a region in the Old World or in the
New England or Middle States would have been as populous as the valleys
of the Loire, or the Housatonic, or Susquehanna long before this. The foothill
counties, tributary to the great interior valley, are rich in gold and
other minerals. The value of these streams, snow-fed, coming down to
water the valley is fully appreciated, and power generated on the south
fork of the Yuba river is used to-day to run the electric railways of cities
by the bay&mdash;over 220 miles away. Off here to the right, beyond Marysville,
as well as on through the Sierra slopes, is the early orange producing region;
oranges go east from this section before Thanksgiving, and practically the
whole crop is shipped by Christmas. The counties of this valley yield annually
over one half of the entire output of the deciduous fruits of California.

Shasta Springs, with its crystal water bubbling up near the track, and peerless

of the Siskiyou range, with the never-to-be-forgotten

with farmhouses that look like New England,
with their white paint and green blinds; with
fruitful orchards, long stretches of green fields,
glimpses of mining operations, and always
mountains and forest, and forest and mountains,
near and far. Here, in southern and
eastern Oregon, is a comparatively new paradise
for the sportsman, and a wondrous scenic
region. Here are chances for stop-over trips,
long to be remembered, with prospects of big
game trophies that will afford countless texts
for hair-raising stories at home.</p>

<p>This Rogue river valley country, of which thriving Ashland and fast-growing
Medford&mdash;cities of stone and brick&mdash;are the centers, sends broadcast,
annually, thousands of boxes of the finest apples, pears and peaches. These rolling
valleys and forest clearings make an unexcelled fruit and farming country. Jacksonville,
off to the west, is on the old California trail; the first gold discovery of
Oregon was near here, on Jackson creek. Over this trail, which the railroad
closely follows, traveled adventurous trappers and hunters, and after
that, the gold seekers, before the days of wagon-roads or railways. The road
skirts the red waters of the Rogue&mdash;originally called Rouge by French-Canadian
trappers of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&mdash;as far as Grant&rsquo;s Pass, a
bustling city that is the center of a rich lumber, gold and copper mining and
farming country. The Rogue and its tributaries, like other Oregon rivers, are fast flowing and
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
never failing streams, with rapids and waterfalls at frequent intervals,
fringed by forest trees that help make pictures at every turn. Here, at
Gold Ray, an enterprising electric power company has developed tremendous
power, which will be used for the many mining industries, as well as
in the progressive ranches and homes, through all this region.</p>

<p>Around Roseburg, about two hundred miles southerly from Portland,
are vast forest resources, with outlying valleys and ca&ntilde;ons and mines and
farms that help to make this a thriving place. Long before reaching
here the road crosses and recrosses the Umpqua river, which
flows through its fertile valley northwesterly into the sea. At
Cottage Grove, as at other points along here, there are more signs of
Oregon&rsquo;s rich mines, signs of the placer camps of early days, as
well as of the more recent developments in quartz mining. The records
show that gold to the amount of $120,000,000 was washed from the
streams of Oregon during the early &rsquo;60s. During recent years there have
been many gold strikes, and to-day all through
these ranges prospectors and expert agents
for mining capitalists are searching and locating the precious metal.
The famous North Pole mine, for example, ranks among the largest and
is valued at over fifteen million dollars. At Cottage Grove, the road
first touches the picturesque Willamette river, following its course to
Eugene&mdash;seat of the University of Oregon&mdash;crossing it at Junction City,
touching it again at Albany&mdash;a big shipping point for luscious Oregon
prunes; again at Salem, the state capital, a city of 15,000 people, and at
Oregon City.</p>

<p>At Oregon City are the falls of the Willamette, where the power of the
river is harnessed for the use of many factories. A ship canal has been built
around the falls. The Willamette valley is one of the most fertile and
most beautiful river regions of any land, stretching southward from
Portland across eight counties and occupying four million acres of rich
land. It is a natural center for dairying and diversified farming. A total
failure of crops has never been known.</p>

<p>The Willamette itself is broad
and swift flowing, with banks lined with
forest trees of perpetual verdure. From north to south the river meanders,
now lazily, now with a rush of leaping waters. It passes through a delightful
pastoral country where the farmhouses are framed in fruit orchards
and sleek cattle feed by the river pastures. Now and then the banks
rise sheer in tree-crowned cliffs fifty feet in height. There are plenty
of fish and wild life abounds. There are many canoe clubs at
Portland and during the summer the Willamette is crowded with the
fleet of light craft while trips up and down the river are in great favor,
sometimes extending for days and covering a voyage of one hundred
miles, the distance by river between Portland and Albany. From
Portland to Salem the capital city, a steamer plies the fifty miles of
waterway. House boats, often of luxurious design, are in high favor
on the quieter reaches.</p>

<p>At Portland, near which the Willamette joins the Columbia, it
becomes the city&rsquo;s harbor from which the average outgoing cargo
runs up to seven thousand five hundred tons. Portland, the &ldquo;rose
city,&rdquo; where roses bloom in profusion on Christmas day, came prominently
before the public eye of late with the centennial celebration of the
great overland journey of the explorers Lewis and Clark. It is a
beautiful city, superbly situated, with surroundings that suggest wealth
and culture, and promises everywhere for a glorious future. The
streets, outside the business quarter, are shaded by overarching trees
and lined with beautiful villas set in green lawns and flower beds of
riotous, fragrant bloom. From Portland Heights, reached by the car
lines, the panorama is superb, the view including Mount Rainier, a
hundred miles away to the north, with the blue barrier of the Cascades
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
stretching to Mount Jefferson, a hundred miles to the south, snow-clad
Mount Saint Helens and Mount Hood, the Columbia river and its
giant gorge, the tributary Willamette and
the green of the nearer low-lands, gleaming here and
there with the lakes of the Columbia valley; a prospect
declared by Caspar Whitney, to be the grandest and most interesting in
natural beauty he had ever seen. Higher yet is Council Crest, once a
favored place for Indian conferences, fifteen hundred feet above the
city; reached by the street cars; the projected site of a great hotel.</p>

<p>In Portland is the constant stir of progress and commercial development&mdash;it
is in the air. With the completion of a forty-foot ship channel
from the city to the sea, to which end surveys are being conducted
by the government, the largest vessels will have no difficulty
in making Portland. Business enterprises of all sorts thrive; the building
up of attractive suburbs, and of seaside resorts such as Long Beach
and Yaquina bay&mdash;all these mean that here is a city of 160,000 people
that will bear watching. There is no use hurrying through Portland;
there is too much to be seen and done; you
cannot overlook the fast-flowing Columbia,
with its close-bordered forests and its matchless
cascades and varied scenery. Powerful
and comfortable steamers stem the torrent
of the mighty river and at the rapids of the
Dalles, close to the mystical, mythical Bridge
of the Gods, a system of locks has challenged
and overcome Nature&rsquo;s mastery of her
aquatic highway. Portland is famous for
its hotels and hospitality, its fine streets
and buildings, its clubs, its schools and
churches. Civic pride is evident everywhere;
art galleries, a notable library, beautiful
avenues, parks and homes, with an excellent
car system reaching far out into its pleasant
suburbs, all speak of culture, wealth and
progress. Here the traveler may rest and
think over his trip and consider his return
journey, providing this western land so seemingly new, so ever green,
so bustling with activity, so wide-awake, so climatically glorious, does
not hold him, as it has held many others, in bonds that they would
not break:</p>
